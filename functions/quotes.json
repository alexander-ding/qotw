Basically, the plan is for those three people to trade off \nrunning QOTW between weeks so we can devote more people to sending QOTW \nfrequently.\nJake Rast has expressed reservations about this, so he might end up \nfleeing with his army to Gaul.\n\nThe winner of the last edition was an anonymous quoter who said: \n\"LaCroix tastes like if someone ate a fruit salad then burped in your \nsparkling water.\"  Gotta agree with you there, anonymous dude.\n\nQUOTES:\nWe received an excess of submissions about harm to and from babies as \nwell as early Christianity:\n\n1. \u201cNo Fear Shakespeare is like opioids\u201d \u2014Ms. Brewster\n\n2. \u201cLike, if you got in a fistfight with a baby, the baby would lose.\u201d \n\u2014Mr. Kerner\n\n3. \u201cLittle babies can kill you if you choke on them.\u201d \u2014Al\u00ebna\n\n4. \u201cSometimes in the mornings I just want to wake up and put on clothes\u201d \n\u2014Markus Tran\n\n5. \u201cCalculators are like some students, they don't know anything, but \ncan still spit out an answer.\u201d \u2014Mr. Sherry\n\n6. \"Have y\u2019all heard of CBT\" \u2014Ms. Dale\n\n7.

We're keeping the damn\nthing.\"\nIf the former- goodbye. It's been real, as they say.\nIf the latter-\nMWAHAHAHA. You poor bastards are stuck with our nagging for a while\nlonger!\n\nOne very, very important apology: when compiling the weekly\nwinners for the email you all got two weeks ago, I somehow managed to leave\nout the last one- Mario's witty gem about the Burning Toilet Paper Roll\nAward for the most under-rated junior! He therefore was unfairly deprived\nof a quite legitimate shot at the Quote of the Year title. I'm truly sorry,\nMario, but there's nothing I can do but give you this Honorable Mention of\nsorts.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the awards!\n\nMOST NOMINATIONS:\nMr.\nDavis, with 18- more than twice as many as the next.\nThis came, I think,\nfrom both of us being in his English class and often having to supply most\nof the submissions ourselves. That isn't to say this award isn't deserved,\nof course- I'm sure he'd have won anyway, though perhaps not so\ndramatically.\n\nMOST WEEKLY WINS:\nA tie between Mr. Davis and Ms. Grant,\neach with three.\n(Eagle-eyed readers will note that Mr. Davis arguably has\nfour- generally speaking, I've given each person involved in a winning\npiece of dialogue credit for a win, but I just didn't feel right about\ngiving Mr. Davis, Shaul, Ben K., Maria, and myself credit for that\nparticular winner, so none of us received credit.)\n\nWILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN\nAWARD for most nominations without a victory, in honor of America's most\nconsistent Presidential loser:\nA three-way tie between Ms. Budding, Dan F.,\nand Danny Mo., each with four.\n\nMOST QUOTABLE, based on a weighted points\nsystem which was modeled [by me] on what Ben Orlin appeared to have done\nyears ago, and which later received Ben's blessings; future Quoters should\nget in touch with me to find out what I [and Ben] did:\n(top ten listed in\nascending order for maximum drama\n10.

Asa, though, barely got any submissions and had\nto singlehandedly submit nearly -all- of the quotes\u2014a task which I cannot\ndo for reasons unknown and having \u2013nothing- to do with laziness. My e-mail\nto you all the next week was a congratulation to you on Asa hitting a\nsensitive spot and having you finally submit a substantial amount, and from\nwhat I remember, we actually got an Honorable Mentions e-mail of\nsignificant size sent that day. But this doesn\u2019t have anything to do with\nwho is sending the quotes. The week after, because of Tech Week and the\nSpanish exchange, it was more convenient for Asa and me to switch weeks.\nThat day we barely hit the minimum (several minutes before I sent the\ne-mail), and after I yelled a little, Asa had sufficient quotes and did not\nyell, leading to \u2013another- message from Asa with sufficient quotes, and you\ncan see the trend, which ultimately brings us to today. How many\nsubmissions did we get today, after three weeks without so much a word on\nhow your quoting is insufficient? Seven.\n\tThat\u2019s right. Seven. If you look at our past messages, they all contained\nten quotes. That\u2019s the standard which we want the e-mail to have, the bar\nthat was set for QOTW (after Asa\u2019s comments, though, we had 15 votes,\nthough), but you barely did half of that job. Now, considering this trend\nwhich I see, a message has insufficient quotes, causing the quoter to rant\nat you all, causing quotes to pile in, making quoter 2 congratulate you on\nfollowing through, causing the process to repeat once you don\u2019t feel\nguilty. Now, it could be something other than a combination of guilt,\nlaziness, and forgetfulness. I mean, for example, maybe the \u2013entire school-\nvarious parents have set some rule on Internet use so that you can use it\nas much as you want one week and cannot use it at all the week after. I\u2019m\nfully unaware of this, but if your inability to perform a simple, almost\nmenial task that takes less than a minute is because of forces beyond your\ncontrol, then please disregard everything that I said so far.\nNow, I could just ask Asa whether we should both rant at you \u2013all- the\ntime and hope the constant pressuring will actually accomplish something,\nbut I would generally assume that you enjoy these paragraphs (read: this\nparagraph. I just wrote an essay for you guys, and I\u2019m really sorry about\nthat) being short and witty, emphasis on the short, and to get right to the\nquotes. I\u2019m going to stop this now and hope that this was actually a\nproductive e-mail. If you want to show that you can help us run this,\nplease submit at http://qotw.net/submit.php. Like, actually submitting this\ntime. The winner of last week\u2019s e-mail is Mr. Davis and Ben Kaufman, saying\n\u201cMr. Davis, there\u2019s a gas leak and we need to go outside right now!\u201d to\nwhich Mr. Davis responded, \u201cDon\u2019t call me a gas leak! That\u2019s very\noffensive.\u201d \n\nThis week\u2019s quotes are:\n\n\u201cI realized last night that I can sum up Brimmer academics with one\nquestion from my 6th grade history test:\nQ: What does \u201cAD\u201d stand for?\na: Anno Domini \nb: Andrew's Dominoes\u201d\n--Julia Kelly\n\n\u201cI feel like that's more of an incentive to be close to God, not going to\nheaven!\u201d\n--Skye, on getting 72 Virgins\n\n\u201cSorry, I was being patriotic and lost track of time.\u201d\n--Ben Kaufman, returning to school from the Tea Party rally on the Common\nten minutes late for Mr. Davis' English class\n\n\u201cStop distracting me, you hot high school girls!\u201d\n--Hannah K. H.\n\n\u201cIf you show me your buboes, I might be able to cure you.\u201d\n--Ms. Grant, when discussing how women in Medieval Europe would abandon\ntheir modesty if male doctors could save them from the Black Death\n\n\u201cSomeone needs to give the guy a Britney Spears CD.\u201d\n--Hannah K-H, on the pretentious musical tastes of a peer\n\n[Student reading aloud from the Alexander the Great book]: \u201cWith regard to\nbodily pleasures, [Alexander] enjoyed perfect self-control...\u201d\n[Mr. Conolly]: \u201cMaybe after he was dead!\u201d\n\n\n\nNow, following this trend, after Asa told you all to vote last week, which\nyou did do, you will not vote at all this week, so I\u2019d just like to remind\nyou to do so by replying to this e-mail or going to\nhttp://qotw.net/voting.php. Voting ends at 5:00 PM on Friday, and\nsubmissions continue until the e-mail is sent, which doesn\u2019t matter because\nyou should then submit it for the week after.

I apologize for all of this,\nand it might just be the very routine sleeplessness, but I\u2019m very tired of\n(while?) ranting about this again and again, and if you don\u2019t submit, I\nwill fill in the quotes with things I think up on the spot.

We're all very lucky that one\nperson decided to submit two quotes in one e-mail, giving us what we know\nas the bare-minimum-and-if-it\u2019s-lower-than-that-you-did-a-bad-job of ten\nquotes, so anonymous two-quote-submitter, please give yourself a pat on the\nback because if you were a little lazier, the QOTW subscriber list would be\nslightly less amused (there may be some of you who quoted twice in separate\ne-mails, so please give yourselves a pat on the back as well if you wish to\ndo so). On a lighter note, our winner for this week is Ms. Grant, saying\n\"You know\u2014okay...look; you can't go through life like this! \u2018Where's your\nson?\u2019 \u2018OH... I left him on the playground...\u2019\" Whether or not she\u2019s talking\nfrom experience, we don\u2019t know, but congratulations Ms. Grant! Anyways, it\nwould be quite funny if I would forget to tell you how to submit in all of\nthis talk on how you don't submit, but I\u2019m sure that there won\u2019t be a\nstudent who thinks to himself \u201cHe didn\u2019t post the link to the voting and\nsubmissions pages on the QOTW site for the sake of irony! This joke is so\nwell played that I\u2019m inspired to submit despite his lack of instructions!\u201d\nthough if you do think that, just pretend the rant ended after\n\u2018congratulations Ms. Grant!\u2019 because the link to submitting is\nhttp://qotw.net/submit.php and to vote, you simply reply to this e-mail.\n\nSo sorry for the wall of text, and the bashing.

Don't worry about Ms. Jackman; I can take her on. She may be taller\nthan me, but she's British.\" -Ms. Rome. Two disclaimers: Ms. Rome tries to\nbe fierce but inevitably finds herself baking you brownies and playing you\namusing children's songs about Columbus not deserving a holiday on her\nlaptop while she moves your paper deadline back a day. Seriously, ask her\nto move the paper back a day. Remember, she's Jewish, so you can guilt her\ninto it if you kvetch. Secondly, if any of you add a snarky opinion on the\nuse of \"ironically\" to the end of your emails-you know who you are-I will\npunish you by uninviting you to the Jackman-Rome Showdown at lunch in 3E\non Thursday. Tickets are $5 (that's $5.7485 in Canadian).\n\nAnd now for the nominees:\n\n\"We could call it a 'friending' machine.\" -Tili, if we could get friends\nout of a vending machine\n\n\"It gives me a strange sort of self-esteem...I feel like a transit pimp.\"\n-Stuart, on having 5 Charlie cards (the new MBTA passes)\n\n\"Can I empty my coffee into your sink, or will it explode?\" -Ms. Rome,\ninterrupting a chem class\n\n\"You can be excited about life but, you know, when life gives you lemons\nyou'll try to eat them.\" -Ben Pokross\n\n\"Does he decide who's crazy?\" -Aaron Stern, on Lord Ashley, the lunacy\ncommisioner\n\n\"No, Meg, that's the only sunlight of my whole day!\" -Ms. Jackman to Meg\nShort, pulling down the window shade in Chem Lab\n\n\"Yeah, well, you're trusty like Joe Lieberman.\" -Russell to Danny Moraff\n\n\"Join Ms. Bluestein for mellow times up in 3B the second half of lunch.\"\n-Mr. Wharton (mind and body announcement)\n\n\"Decline moira. Hey, that's my mom's name, must be a coincidence. Although\nshe is rather fig-like...\" -Mr. Conolly in Latin class\n\n\"Yesterday it's the British peerage, today it's genocide. I teach you more\nfrom Regency novels than from the textbook.\" -Ms. Budding, lamenting\ndistractions\n\n     And that's all for this week. We've got a good selection of HMs (Sign\nup by emailing honorablementions-subscribe at qotw.net). What we really need\nis some fresh quoters. If you feel like quoting, send a reply email with\nyour name (underclassmen: this means you). It's fun and easy and people\nwill say absolutely ridiculous things around you all week in an attempt to\nbe quoted (this is doublely true for teachers, although they'll try to\ndeny it).

The\nfaovred excuse seems to be \"I'm a busy senior, what do you want from me?\"\nand the answer is \"a fifteen minute email, maybe some chocolate if you\nhave any,\" although this response generally gets me a whack on the head\nwith a college fact book. I have not been able to get in touch with this\nweek's quoter, but he/she was not a senior, which leads me to the sinking\nsuspicion that this time it might be my fault.

Not that I'm bitter.\n     I hope that you'll forgive us for the time we've missed and accept\nthis belated email as a sign of our repentance. If you're still mad, ask\nme and maybe I'll give you some chocolate (everyone likes\nchocolate, right?). Also, if you, an underclassman, would like to be a\nquoter, please find me and say so: we need you to keep QOTW\nrunning.

I really must\napologize for our lack of judgement; last week our quoter was a freshman\nsaberist.  But anyway, I'm rather amazed right now because I'm sitting\nhere at my computer at 9:22, and may actually have this written by 10. \nFamous last words... I would like to say goodbye to this year's\nCommonwealth seniors, however, since this is their last QOTW email they\nwill receive as such.  We will miss you. Some of us.  Also, I'd like to\ncongratulate everyone who survived the SAT/SAT II's yesterday, but it's\nnot really that impressive, since I took the world history one, and I've\nnever even taken world history.  Which really goes to show how far my\nsanity has gone.  Oh! And one more thing. So that Will doesn't kill me, he\nand Greta are NOT dating. It's a joke. *coughTannercough*  Moving on,\nexcluding all illegitimate quotes, which are much like illegitimate\nchildren in this case, Mr. Connoly won unanimously with his quote \"I want\nto be resurrected as a virile 18 year old!\"  So would we all, Mr. Connoly,\nso would we all.\nAnd the quotes this week are...\n\n\"Last year, Josh Haselkorn and Emily have out an 'Orb of Light.'

You're driving for seven hours and suddenly, 'Hey! There's\nnot as much corn anymore. There's more wheat.\"\n-Mr. Sherry, recommending driving through Nebraska\n\n\"He was the only president to be a cat.\"\n-Mr. Harsanyi on Garfield\n\n\"I'm coming over there pretty soon...you'd better be scared.\"\n-Sasha, losing it in the middle of class\n\n\"It's like Sea World, but with wealth.\"\n -Conor on the nickname \"C-Wealth\"\n\n\"It's hard to find a real woman.\"\n-Nolan (on MMORPGS)\n\n\"He doesn't know trigonometry!

Well by Friday I had a couple things\nwritten down but I was, for the most part, the lamest Quoter ever.

That means\nyou can start making hash marks on your arm in pen during English class\nand begin thinking about all the really fun things you could\nhypothetically do over the summer. Next week is the last full week of\nschool. I believe that speaks for itself.

Canada is like France and the new French\nteacher, Fadila, is from France, and she had some very funny things to say\nand her quotes are now in this quote of the week email. Though it is\ngenerally cruel to quote non native speakers, as you will see, Fadila\u2019s\nquote cannot be misconstrued. It has a pretty clear meaning that she in\nfact repeated to make especially clear.
